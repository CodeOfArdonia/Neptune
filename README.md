# Neptune

**Neptune** is a utility library. It's primarily used for my animation fan work mods. (Also you can tell
this mod as *Animation Fan Work Engine*)

### What provided

- Simple event system & extra event hooks.
- Some package for Item, Entity and so on. Also include some hooks.
- A lot of functional interfaces.

And so on!
